                            <p>After taking the course I was sent home with a pot of Peggy, which was to be my own sourdough starter culture to continue baking at home...I managed to kill her within a few months. Riverford were kind enough to supply with another starter, and this one ive been feeding for 3 years and has been the starter for some of my best bakes.</p>
